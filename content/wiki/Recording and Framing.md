## Recording

In order to create a screencast, download a screen recorder app such as [ScreenCam Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orpheusdroid.screenrecorder) or [AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orpheusdroid.screenrecorder).

To post the video onto a homescreen thread, the video must:

  - be a WebM file
  - be under 3072 KB
  - be no longer than 120 seconds
  - have maximum resolution of 2048x2048 pixels
  - have no audio

More likely than not your screen recording app of choice will not be in the WebM file format. You will need to convert the video accordingly. `ffmpeg`, a command-line utility, is one possible tool; see [this guide here](https://gist.github.com/ndarville/10010916). Otherwise online conversion tools are available, such as [Online-Convert](https://video.online-convert.com/convert-to-webm). 

## Framing

To frame your screenshot in a device mockup, [Screener](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.toastcode.screener) offers the easiest solution. More customizability would entail using Photoshop and finding suitable .psd files.

Below will be listed some decent themes and tweaks as to what I see fit, if anyone has anything to add make your own updated paste when this one is over a year old. If you have questions I may or may not be in the rizon homescreen channel. Otherwise, you can just go shitpost on r/jailbreak.

# Tweaks

- Tweaks are effectively the modifications to your iDevice, Tweaks can range from being visual (aesthetic), all the way to changing system based processes. The latter of this is usually down to people who know what they're doing and how to diagnose when things don't go as expected, however I've included some Tweaks that work well and are easy to use, also there are some Tweaks that work and make significant (and somewhat insignificant) changes visually.

- As a side note, some tweaks break somewhat upon updates, follow the link posted below to check whether the tweak you want is still supported for your iOS version. Also, you have to be exact when searching for tweaks in cydia.

## Selected tweaks and applications

- Activator: Free, allows you to create gestures and use your iDevice much more effectively, can make life A LOT easier!

- Anemone: Free, a MUST for all iDevice jailbreakers! It's how 99% of Cydia's themes are installed

- AppCon: $1.99, a great tool for adding icons you made yourself to a theme (also great for shitposting on /r/iOSThemes)

- Lithium Ion: Free, themes the battery in the status bar (Themes can be found in Cydia and /r/iOSThemes).

- Cylinder: Free, changes the transition between pages, has some really cool effects!

- BytaFont Tweak Mode: Free, changes the font, can be either system-wide or just on a per-application basis (Has an in-built font repository). Currently in iOS 10 the installation is more difficult.

- CClean: Free, remove/hide elements in the Control Center.

- Fortune: $3.00, the only 4chan client that has embedded .webm support. Is a must for users of 4chan on iDevices

- iCleaner Pro: Free, to download this you have to add a source, or repo. To do so go to Sources, tap Edit, then Add and place this link into the box: http://exile90software.com/cydia/beta.
Basically it just un-clutters your iPhone, removes temporary files, cache files that are no longer used, it's especially useful in removing GB's worth of files that you don't use, so you can add more music, themes, apps, porn, shitty memes, whatever.

- Filza: $5.99, A file manager and viewer, gives you access to your entire system with read/write access. This will be useful for any themes that require manual installation. Also has a in-built server so you can turn your iDevice into a mobile server, and also can edit/upload files directly to your iDevice from your PC.

- iWidgets: Free, HTML based widgets on your Homescreen. Adds so much life to your Homescreen, and makes a big difference to your iPhone! (Themes are listed in Cydia and can be found on /r/iOSThemes).

- MessagesCustomiser: Free, to download this you have to add a repo. To do so go to Sources, tap Edit, then Add and place this link into the box: http://chewitt.me/repo/. Allows you to customise your Messages application like no other, full of features!

- MTerminal: Free, absolutely necessary for system maintainence/fixing an accidental screw up.

- Protean: $1.99, changes many elements of the status bar, everything from hiding parts of the status bar, to adding notifications to the status bar for applications (Facebook, SnapChat, Mail, Messages, etc.). has some compatibiliity issues

- Springtomize: $2.99, a must for changing anything and just about everything to do with your iDevice! Currently it is not updated for iOS 10 but should be receiving an update very soon (check leddit/r/jailbreak)

- Zeppelin: Free, replaces the carrier text (ie: AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, etc.) to an image, or to custom text!

# Themes
- Themes are the most significant change to do with iDevices, so here are some that are good baseline themes to start off with! Many do cost, but there are a lot of free themes around!
- Gotham is the best theme ever. This list is heavily influenced by my personal taste.

## Selected themes

- Gotham/Glyphs: Free, arguably the best icon theme to grace iDevice users! Can be downloaded with instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/2bwp18/gotham_theme_395_icons_every_one_i_could_find/).

- Muffin: $2.50, Flat theme that themes pretty much every aspect of the device e.g.: status bar, switches, etc.

- 0xygen: $1.99-$2.99, Shadow-like icons.

- Subtle10: $2.49, Flatter, more consistent take on stock iOS 10 icons

- Zoobhoy Eight: $2.99, One of the best themes ever released, clean and elegant. Is practically 3 themes bundled into one package.

<p>So you've seen the thread on /wg/, maybe /g/, or even dropped by the IRC channel and now you wonder: "how do I make my homescreen look this slick?". This short guide will hopefully serve as an introduction to the world of ricing your homescreen, and lay a foundation for you to expand further.</p>

<p>Most of the recent screens found on this site are made with a combination of a launcher and KLWP. These two applications give you all the tools you need and they work independently so you can choose whatever combination you want. Remember to look through the settings and interface of the apps you download.</p>

<p>The launcher will do the app drawer, icons and gesture controls, while KLWP usually does the ‘wallpaper’ part, meaning any clocks, music information, background images, etc.</p>

<p>As for prices, most applications mentioned have a free version which is fully usable, but purchasing can unlock several additional features.</p>

<h2>Launchers</h2>
<p>A launcher is an application that functions in the same way a desktop environment would. It offers a homescreen where you can place icons, display a wallpaper and gives you access to an app drawer. Stock launchers are generally very limited, and don’t offer much functionality beyond icons and widgets. Custom ones allow you to add touch gestures and customize your app drawer.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of different launchers available on the play store, so it is encouraged you look at them yourself and find one with the featureset you need.</p>

<p>To replace your launcher, all you need to do is download one of your choice and set it as default after pressing the Home button.</p>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher">Nova Launcher</a> is the most commonly used launcher, If you want even more customizability than what Nova offers, you might want to check out <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.launcher2">Total Launcher</a></p>

<h3>Icon packs</h3>
<p>One of the features of a launcher is to apply custom icon packs, which again, there are tons of on the play store for every taste and lack thereof. They are a quick way to make your entire homescreen seem consistent. An icon pack is just what it sounds like, an application that comes with a bunch of icons.</p>

<p>You can apply an icon pack on your launcher by downloading one and selecting it in your launcher's settings. Almost all third-party launchers support it. You can always look on Google Play for more apps, but here are some of the most popular icon packs seen in the homescreen threads:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/themes/icons-pack-glyphs-tokems-t3019186">Glyphs</a>: If you want simple white lines, this is the one to go with, well proportioned and with lines not too thin, this is the best option, though it is a bit limited in scope</li>
	<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kecil.dashboard">Kecil</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=website.leifs.delta">Delta</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also change icons individually, usually by tapping and holding on an icon (note: dynamic icons, like calendars or weather, will not automatically update when a manual one is set).</p>

<h2>KLWP</h2>
<p>Kustom Live Wallpaper is an app that allows you to make your own live wallpapers in a fairly simple wysiwyg editor.</p>

<p>There are quite a bit of resources when it comes to klwp. Here are some we have found to be quite useful for beginners, they cover most basics like how to make a button:</p>
